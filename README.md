This repository captures a data cleaning project that revolves around enhancing the quality and structure of a dataset. The initial steps involved downloading the dataset, creating a MySQL database, and uploading the data for further processing. The primary focus of this project is on meticulous data cleaning, employing various operations to ensure data integrity and coherence.

Key Cleaning Operations:

1. Standardize Date Format:
 
    ● Standardized date formats across the dataset for consistency and ease of analysis.

2. Address Standardization:

    ● Populated missing property addresses.

    ● Separated address information into individual columns for better clarity (Address, City).

3. Owner Address Enhancement:

    ● Broke down owner addresses into individual columns (Address, City, State) for improved data organization.

4. Categorical Value Standardization:

    ● Standardized 'Y' and 'N' values to 'Yes' and 'No' in the 'Sold As Vacant' field for clarity.

5. Data Quality Assurance:

    ● Removed duplicate entries to ensure accurate and reliable information.

6. Optimization:

    ● Deleted unused columns, streamlining the dataset for improved efficiency.

Throughout these cleaning operations, changes were seamlessly updated in the MySQL database, ensuring that the dataset's cleanliness and structure were enhanced simultaneously. This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive record of the data cleaning process, providing insights into the steps taken to refine and prepare the dataset for subsequent analysis.
